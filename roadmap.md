# Public Roadmap

## Now
---
### In Progress
- Understanding why certain scenarios or steps fail during test execution. 

   - We will enable the output of screenshots for failed scenarios and steps and display them in [SpecFlow+ LivingDoc Generator](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow-livingdoc/en/latest/LivingDocGenerator/Generating-Documentation.html). 

### Discovery

- Write and edit Gherkin feature files directly from a Git repository.
  
  - We will enable a way to connect, write, edit and save Gherkin feature files directly from a Git repository without the need of using an IDE.

## Later
---
- Quickly share a feature file with a team member/stakeholder.

   - We will add the capability to open, save and share your written Gherkin feature files with our [free Online Gherkin Editor](https://specflow.org/gherkin-editor/) and  [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/discover). Draft or write your next feature file or scenario and quickly get feedback from your team or stakeholders. Please [leave us your feedback](https://support.specflow.org/hc/en-us/community/posts/360014576238--Online-Gherkin-Editor-Share-a-feature-file-with-GitHub-Gist).


- Write and edit Gherkin feature files directly on a Backlog Item.

    - We will enable a way to write, edit and save your Gherkin feature files directly in the work item details page of Azure DevOps.


- Sign-up for your SpecFlow account using GitHub.

  - We will enable the sign-up with GitHub for your SpecFlow account. Register once and get the most out of SpecFlow. Use [SpecFlow+ Runner](https://specflow.org/plus/runner/), [SpecFlow+ LivingDoc](https://specflow.org/plus/livingdoc/) (only needed for Azure DevOps) and SpecMap completely for free, no license costs.

## Shipped
---
- Working with Bindings and Gherkin Feature Files in [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

  - We will improve the navigation to and from bindings and will enable the generation of skeleton code including step definition methods from feature files. Here you can download and install the latest version: [SpecFlow for Rider Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15957-specflow-for-rider/)
